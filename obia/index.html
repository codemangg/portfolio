            <h2>About the course</h2>
            <p>
                This course deepened my understanding of object-based image analysis as a powerful alternative to
                pixel-based methods. I learned how segmentation creates meaningful image objects by grouping pixels
                based on similarity, and how the choice of scale plays a crucial role in how well these objects
                represent real-world features. I also explored multi-scale analysis, which helped me see how different
                levels of segmentation can reflect the nested structure of landscapes.

                In classification, I worked with both training-based and rule-based approaches. Rule-based
                classification stood out to me for its transparency and ability to incorporate expert knowledge,
                especially when dealing with complex or fuzzy classes. I found that classification is not just about
                labeling but also about understanding spatial context and relationships between objects.

                One of the most valuable insights was how OBIA brings together spatial, spectral, and semantic
                information. Rather than just matching spectral values, I learned to model classes using shape, texture,
                and hierarchy. This required learning how to represent knowledge clearly, whether through structured
                rule sets or semantic class hierarchies.

                Accuracy assessment in OBIA also challenged me to rethink traditional methods. I discovered tools like
                Object Fate Analysis that allow assessment not just of thematic correctness but also of how well object
                shapes and boundaries align with reference data.

                What tied everything together was the role of human perception. The course showed me how OBIA is shaped
                by how we naturally interpret images and patterns, and how our decisions about segmentation,
                classification, and scale are influenced by that.

                Overall, the course taught me to approach image analysis as a process of translating visual and
                contextual understanding into structured, reproducible methods that reflect both the complexity of the
                data and the goals of the analysis.
