      <h2>Bachelor Thesis in Test Automation and Software Quality Assurance</h2>
      <p>
        In my bachelor thesis, I explored how targeted test automation can enhance the efficiency, reliability, and
        scalability of software quality assurance. The project was carried out in collaboration with a company
        developing mission-critical control center software, where manual testing had previously led to bottlenecks in
        release processes.

        The theoretical foundation included an in-depth look at modern test automation strategies, benefits over manual
        testing, criteria for selecting automation candidates, and the integration of automated tests into continuous
        integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I also compared different automation tools and approaches, with a
        focus on long-term maintainability, scalability, and organizational impact.

        The practical implementation was based on Ranorex, a professional UI automation framework. Selected test cases
        were automated and modularized to ensure maintainability and reusability, and then integrated into the company’s
        CI/CD environment. This included working with real systems rather than mocked components, which required robust
        error handling and adaptation to dynamic user interfaces.

        Key challenges included navigating a complex, object-oriented test framework, working with limited
        documentation, and resolving inconsistencies in pipeline execution. Overcoming these challenges deepened my
        understanding of automated test architecture, framework extension, and the importance of stable infrastructure
        for test reliability.

        The final solution significantly reduced manual testing time, improved test coverage, and laid the groundwork
        for further automation within the organization. The project provided valuable experience at the intersection of
        software development, quality assurance, and DevOps practices.
