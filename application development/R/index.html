      <h2>About the implementations</h2>
      <p>
        The assignments were about creating a good and a bad map in R. The good map is well designed and functional,
        while the bad map is intentionally poorly designed to demonstrate what not to do in map creation.<br>
        The final project was about trying to prove the hypothesis that the craters on the moon are unevenly distributed
        in favour of the farside (more craters on the farside). This aligns with current scientific research which
        theorizes that one big impact is the main cause for that condition, enabling volcanic activity on the nearside
        and therefore covering older craters there.

      <h2>Implementations</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Good Map</h3>
        <p>
          This map was created using best practices in cartography and spatial data visualization. It features
          a clean layout, carefully chosen color schemes, appropriate symbology, and balanced design. Labels and
          legends are clear and legible, with all elements arranged to enhance usability and interpretability.
        </p>

      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Bad Map</h3>
        <p>
          In contrast, the bad map intentionally violates effective mapping conventions. It includes excessive or clashing
          colors, disorganized layouts, inconsistent font styles and sizes, and confusing legends. This version serves
          to highlight what makes a map hard to read or misleading, and is used as a teaching tool to recognize poor
          design choices.

      <article>
        <h3>Final Project: Moon Crater Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The final project explores the hypothesis that lunar craters are more densely located on the Moon's farside.
          Using spatial data and mapping techniques in R, crater distributions were visualized and analyzed. The results
          align with current scientific theories, suggesting a massive early impact caused volcanic resurfacing on the
          nearside, hiding many older craters and leading to the asymmetry.
